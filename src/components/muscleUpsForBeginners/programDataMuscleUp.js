          "A sincere thanks for purchasing the Body By Rings (BBR) training program. I’d like to acknowledge you for investing time, effort and money into this unique method. BBR is the culmination of over 6 years of experimentation, research and countless hours of training. The program has been designed to address all aspects of hypertrophy development through the use of bodyweight exercises, no bullshit and no superfluous exercises or false promises. BBR is the only comprehensive bodyweight bodybuilding program utilising gymnastic rings as of 2015. Read this guide thoroughly and study the videos provided. Don’t stick to the program for a few weeks or months and give up. See it through from start to finish and the results achieved will be proportional to the effort and dedication implemented. "

      <h2>{"GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT BBR"}</h2>
      <h3>{"What the program is designed for"}</h3>
      <p>
        {
          "The BBR system has been constructed with the intent of increasing muscle mass via bodyweight exercises using gymnastic rings. Compound exercises which target multiple muscle groups simultaneously serve as the main constituent. Compound exercises have a greater potential for building muscle as it’s possible to make progression with sets, reps or intensity on a consistent basis. This allows a steady improvement in strength and physique development. Unique to the BBR system is the inclusion of isolation exercises with gymnastic rings. Isolating is a must for bodybuilding as certain muscle groups require an additional stimulus to refine the appearance of a physique. Examples include the chest and arms."
        }
      </p>
      <h3>{"What level of strength is needed for BBR?"}</h3>
      <p>
        {
          "You need a solid foundation level of bodyweight strength. Beginners who have minimal experience with physical training need to spend time developing their strength through basic movement patterns. One should be proficient with pushups, pullups and dips. I’d recommend picking up a copy of Begin Bodyweight (BBW) and following the program prior to commencing BBR. Concepts are discussed in BBW which will serve you well for BBR and into the future. It’s logical to be able to perform bodyweight movements competently on a stable environment prior to undertaking the added challenge of instability associated with gymnastic rings. Most people will adjust to the instability experienced when using rings in a few weeks, so don’t fear. The exercise intensity in BBR can be easily increased or decreased to suit varying strength levels. This is made possible by simply changing posture or the height of the rings. The video series provided demonstrates how to do so. This aspect of the gymnastic rings is extremely powerful and provides a seemingly infinite capacity for progression. Therefore, the sets and reps structure outlined can be completed by varying ability levels whilst employing a full range of motion and progressing at a rate appropriate to the individual."
        }
      </p>
      <h3>{"What the program isn’t optimal for,  and the SAID principle"}</h3>
      <p>
        {
          "BBR is constructed with the goal of maximising hypertrophy through the use of high volume and high time under tension protocols. A user of the BBR series should expect to progressively become stronger with basic upper body ring exercises and subsequently develop muscle. Those looking to achieve specific, higher level strength skills such as front levers and planches and are less interested in gaining muscle, should follow a specific training protocol designed for this purpose. Strength skills require dedicated attention to be achieved. Progressing towards skills requires a calculated approach. Simply obey the SAID principle (Specific Adaptations to Imposed Demands) if seeking to get stronger at strength skills. Essentially, strength comes with movements which are practised often (easier said than done, huh?). Focusing on too many aspects of training at once, if the intention is skills, will lead to frustration and a lack of progression because it’s not feasible for the body. "
        }
      </p>
      <h3>{"Warming up"}</h3>
      <p>
        {
          "In order to prepare the body safely for the upcoming training demands it is critical to perform a thorough warm up which addresses all the major joints to be utilised. By choosing movements which address multiple aspects at once, you can reduce the total number of mobility drills required to get the body going, saving precious time. Included in the video series is a handful of preparatory exercises which are worthwhile doing prior to each training session. When done conscientiously, the process should take no more than 10 - 15 minutes. This should be enough to yield a moderate increase in range of motion and blood flow to the upper body. Additionally, use this time to mentally prepare for the upcoming training session. Visualise progression and make a promise to give 100% effort. Performing the stretches dynamically, as opposed to holding sustained stretches, is recommended prior to training. Prolonged static stretches have been consistently shown to decrease power production in the working muscle. In practical terms, this translates to a reduction in the number of reps which can be performed per set. As the exercises in BBR only require a moderate amount of range of motion, the disadvantages of static stretching outweigh the potential temporary benefits for our purposes. Stick to dynamic movements prior to training and sustained static stretches protocols post training. "

      <h3>{"Essential pre-training  and ongoing measurements "}</h3>
      <p>
        {
          "Prior to starting a new training program one should take several objective measurements to serve as a baseline. These measurements can be re-taken at certain intervals along the journey. When tracking progress, it’s easy to fall into the pitfall of subjective assessment which is laden by emotions and influenced by many external and internal factors. Worse yet is making comparisons to others in regard to strength/ physique development. Everyone is on a journey which is unique to the individual. The biggest factor leading to consistency and fulfillment with one’s training is focusing on individual progress. When taking objective measures (reliable, repeatable numbers which don’t lie), assessments can be honestly made over time which allows pinpoint scrutiny to be made where needed. A wise man once said, what gets measured gets managed; this principle should be applied to more than your training program.  The following measurements are highly recommended and will give valuable feedback in regard to the efficacy of training, recovery, etc."

A quality pair will last a lifetime if looked after; a worthy investment! Grab a pair from Amazon as they are a trusted distributor. Select a high quality pair as you won’t need to replace them. If looking elsewhere for gymnastic rings, make sure the straps are numbered which will allow training progress to be tracked objectively over time. "

If training in a recreational gym which does not allow chalk due to the mess it creates, an awesome alternative is liquid chalk. "

Tempo refers to the speed in which an exercise is performed. Using a fast tempo with an absence of control is a common mistake made by both beginners and advanced trainees. Unfortunately, the average person emphasises doing more at the expense of quality. A balance must be kept between maintaining consistent exercise form at a given tempo whilst simultaneously aiming to progressively overload. "

          "The gymnastic rings are the ultimate tool for building upper body strength and muscle due to the endless array of exercises which can be progressed for years to come. Using bodyweight exercises for lower body requires a different approach. For those looking to build bigger legs using bodyweight exercises, download a copy of my lower body workout program Limitless Legs. This program describes how to overload bodyweight exercises so you can train anywhere, anytime with next to no equipment. Whilst following the BBR program it’s recommended to include one session (maximum of three) lower body workouts per week. A higher frequency above three days is not recommended because it will impact recovery and decrease the capacity to progress using the BBR protocol. The design of the training week should always be structured in accordance with the main goals. It’s assumed for those following BBR that the priority is developing the upper body."

Through ongoing research and practical application, this format has been shown time and time again to be effective in regard to hypertrophy. Three upper body sessions per week is on the lower end of the frequency spectrum; results will be good but not optimised. Five upper body sessions appears to compromise recovery ability, inevitably leading to the fifth upper body session being sub-par in terms of intensity. This is a trend which can affect performance in the following week. Therefore, a 4x per week upper body frequency seems to be the sweet spot in terms of allowing adequate recovery to continually apply progressive overload. Instead of training the whole upper body each session, conventionally done with bodyweight training, splitting the day into pushing or pulling will be a refreshing, enjoyable change which equals adherence!"

The weaker side is generally smaller. Unilateral movements are a great opportunity to decrease the imbalance which exists side to side. Always start unilateral exercises with the weaker side first, followed by the dominant side. To maximise output the following rest approach is recommended: Once a set has been completed on the non-dominant side, rest 30-60s before switching sides. Once the set on both sides has been completed, take a longer rest period as outlined in the program. Due to two sets being required to complete one set for unilateral work (left and right) it helps to take a short rest break between the two."

Individuals that tell you otherwise are lying in an attempt to be pseudomotivational or are taking performance enhancing drugs. This ‘beastmode’ mindset generally leads to burnout, overuse injuries or losing passion and being forced to take a recovery period anyway. Alternatively, it’s common to see people ‘going through the motions’ in training due to the inability to sustain a high work output for long periods of time. Even if at the end of 5 weeks of training one feels fresh, take a deload regardless. Accumulation of fatigue will catch up eventually.  Don’t be surprised when a deload is skipped and a lack of progress ensues. A common mistake when failing to progress is the notion that one is not training intensely enough. It’s difficult in the present moment to realise a lack of progress can potentially be due to under-recovering from the accumulation of previous training stress. This point can’t be highlighted enough; applying a deload is essential. A simple deload week may be all that’s required to facilitate recovery, supercompensation and the ability to continue making gains. Erase the foolish 0 or 100 mindset. Submaximal training is not a waste of time and is a necessary component of adaptation. There are multiple ways to deload, yet the following approach is recommended for simplicity, consistency and maintaining strength through continuing to practise the motor pattern of each exercise. "

Doing so will impact the ability to consistently make progress over the weeks, which should always be the number one objective in any training program. Reaching failure sparingly is ideal. Muscular failure is likely to occur during the final set or two of the last exercise performed for the day due to fatigue. This is a good sign that the training intensity/volume selected for the day was ample to induce muscular breakdown and resulting hypertrophic response. Don’t aim to reach failure on every set of every exercise for the day. Long-term progress will be non-existent following this style of training, both physically and psychologically. "

Conversely, inadequate rest will result in being unable to reach full potential as far as training output is concerned. To avoid human error through basing training off emotions, the solution is to invest in an interval timer. Simply set the first timer to match how long it will take to complete a set (30-45s generally), and the second timer to the designated rest period. Clip the timer to a hip, set it to beep/vibrate and get to work. Another method is to begin the rest period manually after completing each set. The aforementioned interval timer has been used by FitnessFAQs for over five years now. If not interested in buying an interval timer, there are free interval timers apps available for use on mobile phones. Remember training is a time to be present and focused on the task at hand. Don’t be a fool and spend this valuable time seeking another social media induced dopamine rush. "

If the available rings don’t have numbers, standing beside a ring and using a landmark on the body is the next most objective method.

If one puts on too much weight in a short period of time, it will be counterproductive to the strength training progress. Remember, we are manipulating our bodies in space - every additional kg of unnecessary tissue makes this more challenging. The best approach is a gradual increase in weight gain as the body can only build muscle at a given rate. Patience is the important factor once again, a good rate of weight gain would be to aim for ~0.5-1kg per month at the most (this equates to 6-12kg gained in a year.) Slow down the rate of weight gain or go into a maintenance phase when body fat percentage is getting too high. By taking the process slowly, strength gains will be progressive through adapting to training at an increased bodyweight. Additionally, a gradual increase in bodyweight will result in a larger proportion of muscle in relation to fat gained during this period.
